# üöù Monorepo notes

This monorepo uses a possibly slightly unorthodox approach to managing some of its contents (at least compared to repos full of only javascript packages, such as Babel).

This is for three reasons:

- The repo contents are cross stack (Dotnet, JS, python...)
- We have a Create-React-App application (`app/client-app`)
- We have javascript packages that are both depended on elsewhere in the repo, *and* published to public registries.

The result of all of this is as follows:

- Non Javascript projects are managed local to themselves, as normal.
  - Really this is because they aren't interdependent.
  - But regardless, work with them as you normally would: from their own project roots.
  - The semi-exception to this is the Visual Studio Solution file in the root of the repo.
- All javascript in `packages/` or `response-items/` use Lerna, npm, and the npm `file:` protocol for local dependencies.
  - Don't use `lerna bootstrap`; this is a `lerna link convert` repo.
  - Shared dev dependencies are in the top level `package.json`
  - `npm install` at the top level; `npm run` top level scripts only.
  - There are no project local `node_modules`.
- The CRA app (`appp/client-app`) is sort of a hybrid.
  - It isn't a Lerna package.
  - `npm install` locally - gives a local `node_modules` directory.
  - `npm run` local scripts. This is necessary so `react-scripts` works properly.
  - However, it still uses the top-level shared dependencies, to ensure version consistency in the repo.
    - so `devDependencies` can be either in the local `package.json` or the top-level one, depending if they're shared.
    - This works due to node module resolution, without worrying about Lerna.
    - technically, all `dependencies` are `devDependencies` because it's a built app not a package.
    - therefore its ok to hoist `dependencies` like `@chakra-ui/core` to the top-level `devDependencies`.
  - This app isn't a published package, so we don't have to resolve the `file:` links; we only distribute the built version.
