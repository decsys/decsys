# üöù Monorepo notes

This monorepo uses Yarn 2 Workspaces for managing dependencies / running scripts across several javascript projects.

This means the following:
- Non javascript projects are managed as normal, relative to their project directories.
- The .NET app is a slight exception to the above
  - Because it hosts a javascript project (`client-app`), its debug build process has similar environment expectations to `client-app`
  - `DECSYS.sln` is actually in the root of the repo, not the project directory.
- Javascript projects have some environment prerequisites.

## Prerequisites for Javascript projects

- Have node.js (`10.x` or newer, so it comes with `npm`)
- Have yarn globally installed.
  - the recommended way today is to install from npm:
    - `npm i -g yarn`
  - this global installation will then use the repo's local version in `.yarn/releases`

## Yarn 2 / Workspaces notes

Some notes on our usage of Yarn 2 in this repo:

- We use **Plug n' Play** mode.
  - no `node_modules` folders.
  - better dependency integrity
  - stricter dependency rules
    - this can have side effects that may require temporary workarounds
- We use **Workspaces**
  - packages installed and cached at the top level of the repo, not per project
  - one `yarn.lock` for the whole repo
  - many `package.json` manifests - one per project.
  - one `.yarnrc.yml` config file for the repo.
  - `yarn` cli commands can be run against a workspace as follows:
    - `yarn workspace <package_name> <command>`
    - e.g. `yarn workspace @decsys/client-app add some-package`
  - scripts can be run against a workspace as above
    - `yarn workspace <package_name> <script_name>`
    - e.g. `yarn workspace @decsys/client-app build`
  - scripts can be run relative to a project directory
    - e.g. `/app/client-app> yarn build`
  - many `yarn` commands are workspace-wide:
    - e.g. `yarn up my-package@latest` will upgrade `my-package` in any package that depends on it.
