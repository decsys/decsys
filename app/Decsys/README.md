# ‚úÖ DECSYS Survey Platform

The DECSYS Survey Platform aims to be a flexible cross-platform web-based survey platform that particularly makes it easy to load custom question response components.

It is used to showcase the DECSYS Ellipse Rating Scale.

# üìù Documentation

For usage and reference refer to the DECSYS Documentation.



## Running as a service

When hosting Decsys on a remote server, you may want to install it as a service, if you don't put it behind a reverse proxy.

For Windows, we recommend using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) to do so.

### ‚ö† Troubleshooting

- Mostly just ensure nothing else is bound to port `80` on your network interfaces.
  - Or edit the launch script to change the port / specify a port when using the `dotnet` CLI
