This document describes the general technology stack, and in particular the technologies used for the Application layer, which do not change between modes.

## Application layer

### Frontend

The Frontend application is a Client Side [React] Single Page Application.

- It's pure JavaScript
  - It is however modern ECMAScript, so is transpiled using Babel.
- It uses a very popular component driven framework: [React]
  - This should be beneficial for developer accessibility
  - It really helped enable the ability to dynamically load custom response items
- It's served by the Backend application process.

### Custom Response Items

Custom Response Items are written as [React] Components, with some additional metadata.

Refer to the [`component-boilerplate` wiki](https://github.com/decsys/component-boilerplate/wiki) for detailed information on the structure of Response Components and how to write them.

- They're [React], the same as the Frontend app.
  - They use [Emotion] so they can be bundled into a single JavaScript file, but still be styled.
- They're modern ECMAScript, using the ES Modules standard
- They're discovered and served by the Backend app at runtime
  - You can drop new components into the `components/` folder locally, and only a page refresh is required to load them.
- They're loaded by the frontend as ES Modules at runtime.
- Using a NoSQL datastore allows us to store response data with flexible schema defined by the Response Items, not the Platform.
- [React] allows Components to use PropTypes to define Parameter and Response schema that the Platform can validate or interact with (e.g. providing a rich editor UI).

### Backend

The Backend application is an ASP.NET Core MVC REST API.

- It's [.NET] so it's cross-platform for Linux, macOS and Windows.
- It's self-hosting - it doesn't require a reverse proxy in front of it.
- It's capable of hosting different content at different routes
  - in the case of the Survey Platform:
    - there are some custom routes which bypass the MVC framework (e.g. `/version`)
    - there are routes to the Client Side application
    - there are routes to MVC controllers (e.g. `/api/...`)

The above points allow keeping with the single-process design for **Workshop** mode while being flexible enough to support running an online service in **Hosted** mode.

Users can just run the backend and everything comes up, or they run an online service in a typical hosting setup.

- The backend can be published as a platform binary which can run anywhere the platform ([.NET]) runtime is available.
- It can also be published as a native executable binary for supported platforms (e.g. `decsys.exe` for Windows).

## Data layer

The architectural approach and data layer technology differs somewhat between operating modes, and this is explained in their own documents:

- [Workshop](./workshop.md) mode
- [Hosted](./hosted.md) mode

However any text datastores (i.e. not for files such as Images) are always a form of NoSQL (or Document based) Database.
