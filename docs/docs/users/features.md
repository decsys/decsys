### Run Surveys from your local computer

Great for use as part of a Workshop, where the survey can be taken by participants in realtime over a local network

### Capture responses using an Ellipse-based Scale

Instead of forcing people to choose 7 or 8 on a Discrete Scale, when they're really a 7.5, or somewhere between 5 and 9, why not let them draw an ellipse on the screen, to accurately record both where on the scale they are, and how confident.

### Capture custom responses

Need a stroop test as a survey question? Easily build one using React and integrate it with DECSYS.

Got an idea for an unorthodox new approach to capturing data? Build that and use DECSYS to trial it, comparing with the current approach.

### Host your own online Survey service

DECSYS can run as an online hosted service, supporting registering multiple users who can each create surveys of their own!
