The DECSYS Survey Platform aims to be a flexible cross-platform web-based survey platform that particularly makes it easy to load custom question response components.

## Getting Started

### Run Surveys with DECSYS

[Start with installing](./installation#workshop-mode-setup) and using DECSYS in **Workshop** mode to get a feel for it!

If you want to host DECSYS online, there's [instructions for that](./installation#hosted-mode-setup) too.

### Create Custom Responses

DECSYS was built to research and showcase an Ellipse-based Scale for capturing survey responses.

If you have an interesting idea for capturing survey responses, or simply want to build a response approach DECSYS doesn't include yet, then [here is the information you need]() to build Response Items of your own.

### Contribute to DECSYS

The [Developer Guide](../devs/contributing/source-code) and [Technical Reference](../devs/technical/architecture) contain all the information about DECSYS' inner workings.

## Where else can I find information?
