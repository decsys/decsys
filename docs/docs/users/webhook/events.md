In Decsys, webhooks are designed to trigger on specific events, particularly focusing on page navigation within the application. This document provides a detailed overview of how these webhook events operate.


### 1. All Events
Select this option to activate webhooks for every page navigation event, providing comprehensive monitoring across the entire survey workflow.
- **Trigger**: Activates on every page navigation event.
- **Current Scope**: Limited to Page Navigation events but may expand in the future.


### 2. Customize Events - Page Navigation
This feature allows targeting specific pages for webhook triggers. By setting criteria for chosen source pages, it offers tailored monitoring for selected segments of the application.

- **All Page Navigation**:
  - Activates the webhook for every page navigation event.
  - Functions similarly to the 'All Events' option, given the current scope.
- **Target Source Pages**:
  - Allows for monitoring specific pages or types of navigation events.
  - Webhooks can be set to trigger based on the defined source pages.

## Target Source Page by using Trigger Filters:
