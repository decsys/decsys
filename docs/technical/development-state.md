The Survey Platform, and the various pieces that come together to make it what it is, are considered version `1.0`.

That is to say, they are feature complete, and stable, for the first version.

There are planned future features and extended capabilities for the platform that will follow in later versions, but you can use it today, and there's enough in it to be useful.

The first major example is that today, in `1.0`, you can run the application locally, as a sole **Admin**, and have users on your local network participate in your **Surveys**. To make this easy, the application runs everything it needs in a single process.

In future, it will be possible to optionally connect to an external database server, or to host the backend and frontend on different machines - perhaps in containers.
