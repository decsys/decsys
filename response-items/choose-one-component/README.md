# DECSYS Component Boilerplate

This repository contains everything needed to create an Interactive Response Component for the DECSYS Survey Platform.

- It implements a very basic component as an example
- it provides build scripts and dependencies for  easily building a component ready to use with the DECSYS Survey Platform.

# Getting Started

1. Either:
    - Download the latest code from `master` and use it as a starting point for your own component.
    - Clone this repository, then set the remote `origin` to another git repository for your own component.
1. `npm install`.
1. Make changes to the files in `src/` to build your component.
    - â„¹ You shouldn't need to touch `index.js`
    - âœ… Add or remove `dependencies` using `npm`
    - âš  Don't modify the `devDependencies` 
        - the build processes depend on them, and are preconfigured for outputting a module the Survey Platform can use.
    - âš  Don't modify the `peerDependencies`
        - they are correctly configured for dependencies the Survey Platform will fulfill.
1. `npm run storybook` to test your component visually and interactively.
1. `npm run build` to build a distributable version of your component which can be used in the Survey Platform.

> â„¹ The first party DECSYS components may also be interesting points of reference.
> 
> ðŸ‘‰ Look for any repository that ends in `-component` in the DECSYS' GitHub organisation.

# Component Response Statistics

> â„¹ [Learn how to add statistics to a component](https://github.com/decsys/component-boilerplate/wiki/Component-Statistics)

The boilerplate does not include statistics by default, as they are optional. For example the built-in [`confirmation-component`](https://github.com/decsys/confirmation-component) doesn't have any.

Examples of stats can be found in the other built in components:
- [`discrete-component`](https://github.com/decsys/discrete-component)
- [`ellipse-component`](https://github.com/decsys/ellipse-component)
- [`freetext-component`](https://github.com/decsys/freetext-component)
