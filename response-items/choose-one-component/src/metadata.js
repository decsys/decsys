// Component Icon

// Import any SVG Component to use as an Icon for the Response Component.
// We recommend a named import from a specific icon file in `styled-icons`
// As this will guarantee tree-shaking down to the individual icon used.
// import { Question } from "styled-icons/fa-solid/Question";

export const icon = <></>;
